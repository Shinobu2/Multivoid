// coop/moderation/ban_list.h -- the host's persistent ban list, keyed by the PROVED player id and,
// when the host saw a real one, the player's own address.
//
// MTA precedent: CBanManager / CBan (reference/mtasa-blue/Server/mods/deathmatch/logic/
// CBanManager.{h,cpp}, CBan.h): a ban's serial, IP and nick persisted to banlist.xml, matched
// (serial, then IP) in Packet_PlayerJoinData before the player spawns (CGame.cpp:1956, :1973); the
// nick is the admin's reference and is never matched. Our serial is the id the identity proof
// established; our IP is the connection's own address, stored only on a direct path
// (IsBannableAddress, moderation::EnforceableAddress).
//
// HOST-ONLY, permanent, in the hosted server's folder as bans.json: the host's start hands that
// folder to Load, and the store keeps it for its writes. A file the load could not read whole is
// never rewritten that session. Locks: a WRITE mutex (outer) guards the disk write, the folder and
// the read-only mark; a SET mutex (inner) guards the set and its index; the set mutex is never
// held across a file write, so the net thread's IsBanned never waits on the disk.

// Divergences from MTA's CBanManager.cpp (reference/mtasa-blue/Server/mods/deathmatch/logic/):
//  - MTA's player ban stores the exact IP (AddBan, :90-96); its wildcard matching (GetBanFromIP,
//    :218-238) applies only to patterns an admin writes into an IPv4 entry. Ours has no
//    admin-written range patterns: no range rule is decided, so an address matches exactly.
//  - MTA allows saving from the start of its load (m_bAllowSave, :290), so an unparseable
//    banlist.xml is overwritten at the next save; ours never rewrites a file it could not read
//    whole, because the rewrite would drop the records it could not read.
//  - MTA refuses a second ban on an already-banned IP (IsSpecificallyBanned, :170-181, used by
//    AddBan at :92 and :106); ours keeps both records, which are keyed by id, and the index
//    answers the first.
