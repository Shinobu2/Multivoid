// coop/session/local_grants.h -- which local dev features this machine may use: the answer the
// feature gates read, from any thread. In a running session it is the host's grant for this
// machine (the host computes its own, a client is sent its own: coop/session/grants_sync); solo
// and the menu keep today's answer, true. One packed word holds the session serial and the bits, so
// a reader never pairs one session's bits with another's; a word written for another serial reads
// as the role's default (coop/permissions/grants_core.h).
// The state is stamped by the session serial, not ended at a session-end seam, a divergence from
// both precedents: readers on several threads cannot take a clear mid-read, and a word of another
// session reads as the role default. Nearest shape: MTA's sync time context, a stamp the receiver
// compares instead of a reset (reference/mtasa-blue/Server/mods/deathmatch/logic/CElement.cpp:1281-1306).
