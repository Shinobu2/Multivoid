// coop/session/teleport_client.h -- teleport connected clients to the host's pose.
//
// A shipped moderation verb, not a dev toy: /tphere (the scoreboard's Teleport runs it) brings one
// client to the host through TeleportSlotToHostWithToken (moderation.cpp), event_feed applies the wire packet on the receiving
// side, and the F1 dev-menu button broadcasts to everyone. A JOIN does not use the wire verb -- a
// joiner places itself (net_pump, through ApplyLocally below), and a host teleport at world-ready
// overwrote that placement, since world-ready arrives after the client has already spawned.
//
// Direction: HOST -> CLIENT only. The action self-gates on Session::Role::Host and no-ops on a
// client. It mirrors MTA's `!tphere` chat command: /tphere is the command, and the scoreboard's
// Teleport button submits that line.
