// coop/session/server_settings_sync.h -- the host's replicated server-scope rows reach every
// client: the snapshot when a slot is ready, a delta after a change, one row per message
// (ReliableKind::ServerSetting). A changed notify row is announced: the host prints one chat line,
// and each client prints its own when the row arrives with the announced bit. The session layer
// itself is the config's (coop/config/config.h); this module is its lifecycle seams and its wire.
