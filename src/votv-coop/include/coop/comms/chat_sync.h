// coop/comms/chat_sync.h -- the T-chat wire half, HOST-AUTHORED.
//
// The UI half, ui/chat_input -- the T-opened input bar, Enter sends, ESC closes -- hands typed text
// to QueueSend (a line that begins with `/` is a command and goes to coop::command_sync), and every
// receiver renders "<nick>: <text>" through coop::chat_feed.
//
// The authority is the host, not the peers. A client's line reaches the host as an INTENT
// (ChatMessage, client to host only); the host commits it to the lobby's record in coop::chat_log
// with a monotone lineSeq and broadcasts an authored ChatLine -- preceded by a ChatSpeaker -- to
// every ready client INCLUDING the origin. The reason is the ORDER, and it is a threading fact
// rather than a preference: a relay fires on the NET thread at receive time, before the reliable
// inbox drains on the game thread, so there is no point on a relay path where a lineSeq exists to
// stamp. The commit and the broadcast have to be ONE act, at ONE authority, on ONE thread. MTA
// reaches the same shape from the other direction: CConsoleCommands.cpp broadcasts a player's own
// line back to them with no exclude argument, exactly as this does.
