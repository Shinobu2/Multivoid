// Spawn one native walking mannequin the way the game's own spawner does: every spawn point is
// shown for a moment (prepareSpawn), and half a second later the points are asked in turn to spawn
// the walker (wMannequinSpawn_C.spawn) until one accepts; a point on screen refuses. All of that is
// the game's. The game shuffles its points; this instrument asks the nearest to the local player
// first. The walker is the game's real one: it opens doors, is saved with the world and returns angry after a load.
// Refused on a client in a session (dev_gate), while an earlier request is still running, and
// when five walkers are alive (the game itself culls above four). Any thread.
void SpawnWalker();

// The frame tail's entry (harness::pump::TickFrameTail): a single atomic read when no spawn is
// pending. Game thread.

// The [dev] mannequin_drill row's phases; a single enum read when it is off. Game thread.

// The local session's last link dropped: the client's samples start over. The host's half runs
// once per process and is not re-armed.
