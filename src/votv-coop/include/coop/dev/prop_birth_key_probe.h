// coop/dev/prop_birth_key_probe.h -- the client place/birth seam instrumented. Read-only, dev-only.
//
// A client's fresh keyed prop spawn is enqueued at FinishSpawningActor and drained a tick later,
// because the game restores the save Key inside loadData, after the spawn returns. Seven drain
// exits discard an entry and three of them are bounded registers -- an 8-tick key wait, a 32-entry
// pending vector, a 64-key park FIFO -- so a prop that never reaches the host leaves no record of
// which bound it hit, or whether it hit one at all.
//
// The probe tallies every exit and histograms the drain tick on which the Key became readable.
// That histogram is the measurement the wait was sized by guess: clustered at 0-2 the wait is not
// what loses props, and anything at the ceiling names the register as the loss.
//
// Observation only -- no admission changes with it on. Ini-gated [dev] prop_birth_key_probe=1;
// off, every entry point is a predicate test and a return. Game thread only. Both roles: the
// finish-spawn hook is role-gated after the birth record, not before.
