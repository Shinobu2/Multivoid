// coop/permissions/grants_core.h -- the local grants' engine-free core: the table of nodes a machine
// shows locally (the dev features), their packing into one 64-bit word, the rule that reads a bit,
// and the rule that says when the host computes them again. Time and the session's serial are
// parameters; nothing here logs, reads a clock or includes the engine layer, so the selftest drives
// it whole and the future arbiter links it as it is. The session glue is coop/session/local_grants
// (the lock-free answer) and coop/session/grants_sync (the host's tick and kind 168).
