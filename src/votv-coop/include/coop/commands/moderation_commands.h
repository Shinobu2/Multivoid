// coop/commands/moderation_commands.h -- the moderation verbs as commands: /kick, /ban, /banid,
// /unban, /tphere.
//
// A domain's command bindings: this file registers the roots into a Registry and the handlers
// call the domain through the PORTS handed in, captured by value, so no file static holds them.
// The production registry is given the real ports (coop/moderation, command_sync); the selftest
// gives its own Registry fakes that record what they receive. The dispatcher has already decided
// who may run a command and has checked its qualifiers (offline target, an offline id the host
// has no record of, exempt target, who is told): a handler here never asks the permission system.
//
// Engine-free like the model files: it reaches coop/moderation only for the verbs' types, and
// coop/permissions for the action record.
