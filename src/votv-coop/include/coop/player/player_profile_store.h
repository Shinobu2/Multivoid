// coop/player/player_profile_store.h -- where the HOST keeps each player's profile blob: the newest
// one in memory, and a copy on disk that is cut only when the host's world is saved.
//
// A profile and the world are two halves of one state. An item a player pockets leaves the world
// and enters the profile, so a disk profile NEWER than the saved world holds that item twice after
// a host restart, and an OLDER one loses what the player dropped. So a profile goes to disk as it
// stood when the saved world was GATHERED, and at no other moment: not on a disconnect, not on
// shutdown, not on a timer. A host that quits without saving reverts its world to the last save,
// and the profiles revert with it. docs/players.md has the whole account.
// MTA saves an account when it changed and 15 s have passed, and at quit (CAccountManager.cpp):
// its world is not persisted, so its accounts have nothing to stay consistent WITH; ours has.
// The file is <game dir>/coop_players/<save slot>/<guid>.json, keyed per save slot. The blob is
// opaque here (coop/items/inventory_wire owns its layout); the file wraps it in a magic, an FNV
// hash, a nick and a last-seen time. A GUID that is not exactly 32 hex characters never becomes a
// path component. Game thread: the memory half has no lock.

// such a file is the last gather's, so the profiles beside it must be too. Not closed: a profile
// reaches the host up to a second after the pickup it reports (the client's 1 Hz poll), so a save
// inside that second cuts a profile one pickup behind its world.

// stays for the next cut; a profile that is on disk and unchanged since is let go of, because Get
// gives it back from its file. One world is written under more than one name: a quicksave writes
// a new <main>_SUB_<n> file, and a plain save made after loading a subsave writes the main slot.
// So a cut to another slot first makes that slot's directory a copy of the set -- every player's
