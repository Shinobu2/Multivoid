// coop/player/stat_orders.h -- an admin's order to, and query of, one player's stats and effects
// (StatOrder, StatOrderReply, StatQuery, StatQueryReply): the engine half of coop/player/
// stat_orders_wire. The host sends and the owner applies, because a player's stats exist only in
// its own process. Game thread throughout.
//
// An order sets one row of the stat table, adds a status effect or removes one. On a row the host
// stores, the owner sends its fresh profile BEFORE its answer, on the lane the profile rides, so
// the host's stored profile follows the owner's own and the host checks it before saying so. The
// host's own player (slot 0) is ordered and read in place by the same apply and the same read.

#pragma once

// MTA stamps a synced set with a sync-time context so a stale puresync cannot overwrite it
// (reference/mtasa-blue/Server/mods/deathmatch/logic/CElement.cpp:1281); here the host never writes
// its copy at send time, so nothing is stamped. For the query pair, MTA's resendPlayerModInfo
// (reference/mtasa-blue/Server/mods/deathmatch/logic/luadefs/CLuaPlayerDefs.cpp:49) asks a client
// for data it alone holds, and the Source SDK's convar query answers under a cookie and a status
// (reference/source-sdk-2013/src/public/engine/iserverplugin.h:36-43, 110-113, 160). The closer
// tagged-request and status-reply shape is MTA's takePlayerScreenShot
// (reference/mtasa-blue/Server/mods/deathmatch/logic/CStaticFunctionDefinitions.cpp:3329-3349,
// reference/mtasa-blue/Server/mods/deathmatch/logic/packets/CPlayerScreenShotPacket.cpp:18-88); ours
// is stricter: the token, the slot and the generation must all match. Shapes only; the pull and the
// missing opt-out are explained at SendQuery.
