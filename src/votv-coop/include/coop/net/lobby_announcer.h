// coop/net/lobby_announcer.h -- the host side of the master plane.
//
// MTA is the precedent: CMasterServerAnnouncer and CMasterServer announce on host start, then keep the
// lobby alive with a periodic heartbeat. We diverge in three ways: one master rather than a redundant list,
// a 30 s heartbeat -- three to the master's 90 s lobby expiry -- and an explicit leave on stop.
//
//   POST /v1/host        sessionId, an opaque lobbyId, the host token, identities and ICE
//   POST /v1/heartbeat   every 30 s: the lobby kept alive, its player count and their links, the host's
//                        TURN credential reported and its renewal taken from the answer
//   POST /v1/visibility  the "hide from the browser" toggle; POST /v1/leave on stop
//
// Threading: Host() blocks, so call it on a worker. On success it spawns the heartbeat worker thread, and
// Stop() signals and joins it. The credentials are mutex-guarded, since the heartbeat thread reads them
// while SetListed writes listed_ and a re-announce replaces them.
