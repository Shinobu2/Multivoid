// ue_wrap/actors/vitals.h -- the local player's stat table (engine substrate), and the profile
// snapshot of the save object's per-player state.
//
// Twenty-two rows, each a stat of the local player on the object that owns it: the save object
// (UmainGameInstance_C::save_gameInst, a UsaveSlot_C and exactly ONE per machine), the pawn (the
// gamemode's own `mainPlayer`, the game's reference to the local player) and the gamemode. Every
// row names its property once, in this module's table, and is resolved by NAME per owner class:
// Blueprint-cooked offsets shift across recooks and are never hardcoded. Game thread only
// (UObject lookups and blueprint-state writes). No network, coop or quantization logic
// (principle 7): the callers in coop/ own the wire encoding.
//
// CAUTION: there is exactly ONE saveSlot per machine, and every remote-player puppet AND the
// local player resolve to it. This accessor only ever touches the LOCAL player's stats. NEVER
// use it to store a remote puppet's display health -- that would corrupt the local player's
// persisted health. Puppet display health lives on coop::RemotePlayer.
